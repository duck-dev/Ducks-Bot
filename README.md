# Ducks-Bot

Discord Bot written in C# with DSharpPlus, designed according to my imagination of a 
functional Discord Bot.

### Before you start
If you plan to create your own Discord bot, before you start programming, set up the project first.
Assuming you want to use DSharpPlus, please refer to their 
[official documentation](https://dsharpplus.github.io/articles/basics/bot_account.html) for the 
first steps. Don't worry, every other API wrapper certainly has a documentation too.
Google will help you to find it :)
